**Art Dealer Game: 
Overview**
The Art Dealer Game is an educational card-based game that teaches computational thinking, mathematical patterns, and logical reasoning. Designed for K-8 students, players act as gallery owners selecting paintings (represented by playing cards) and must identify hidden patterns to win the game. The game has three difficulty levels, each suited to different age groups and offering more complex patterns as the levels progress.
**How to Play**
**Step 1: Launching the Game**
**1. Download and Install:**
- Download the ArtDealerGame.exe file onto your computer.
- No installation is needed—simply double-click the .exe file to launch the game.
**2. System Requirements:**
- The game is designed for Windows operating systems. If you are using a Mac or Linux, you can run the game using compatibility tools like Wine or through a virtual machine.
**Step 2: Choose a Level**
After launching, you will be prompted to select one of three difficulty levels:
- Level 1 (K2): Designed for Kindergarten to 2nd-grade students.
- Level 2 (Grades 3-5): For students in grades 3-5, with more challenging patterns.
- Level 3 (Grades 6-8): For older students, offering the most complex patterns and a multiplayer mode.
**Step 3: Gameplay Flow**
**1. Card Selection:**
- **Level 1 & 2:** The game acts as the 'Art Dealer' and automatically selects three random cards from a deck. As the 'Gallery Owner,' you must choose a fourth card that completes the hidden pattern.
- **Level 3:** Two players take turns as 'Art Dealer' and 'Gallery Owner.' The 'Art Dealer' selects cards, while the 'Gallery Owner' guesses the pattern.
**2. Identifying the Pattern:**
- **Level 1 Patterns:**
  - All cards are red (Hearts or Diamonds).
  - All cards are black (Spades or Clubs).
  - All cards have the same suit.
- **Level 2 Patterns:** In addition to the patterns from Level 1:
  - All cards have the same number.
  - All cards are prime numbers (2, 3, 5, or 7).
  - The sum of the card values is 21.
- **Level 3 Patterns:** Includes all patterns from Level 2, plus:
  - All cards are even numbers.
**3. Winning and Losing:**
- If your selected card matches the pattern, you win and the game celebrates with balloons!
- If you choose incorrectly, you get up to three chances to correct your selection. If you don’t succeed in three attempts, you lose.
**4. Replay Option:**
- After each round, you will have the option to play again or quit the game.
